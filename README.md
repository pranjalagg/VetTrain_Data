| Under-explained | Interviewer: Gotcha okay, well, I appreciate your time, and um so, if it's alright with you i'm going to go ahead and get started here on some of the more formal questions. Interviewer: So obviously looking at your resume I can see, you know you've had a lot of experience working in a team environment, can you tell me about a time when you built strong relationships, where none previously existed and what was the outcome of that. Veteran: So I would say that that would be where. Veteran: Um. Veteran: When I took over as a as a platoon sargeant or actually as a drill sergeant well I did time as a drill sergeant in a. Veteran: It was a while ago uh but. Veteran: Uh. Veteran: Taking young young people into the army and showing them how to become a cohesive cohesive team and to. Veteran: Uh. Veteran: accomplish a goal that they didn't really understand and and be able to work as a team with various different aspects and thoughts on how to accomplish the goals that needed to be accomplished.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Did not answer the question fully; vague. Gave little information and required prompting from the interviewer to elaborate. A more detailed example would be a better response. |
| Succinct        | Interviewer: Good, good. And then, last two questions here is: why would we, or why should we select you for, for this job over another candidate? Veteran: Uh, I don't know. Um, I have my unique experinces that uh, nobody else does have. And I get, we, we're not going to know until I get there and I do it. So I can't say that I'm better than anybody else. You know, I don't know if that's the, the right answer, but um, it's an honest one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Answered the question briefly and to the point.                                                                                                                                 |
| Comprehensive   | Interviewer: Ok, cool. Cool cool. Um- Interviewer: I And then, when you were talking about the-the-the security, uh, sectional leader, in Bahrain, uh, obviously a- a lot of folks that uh- Interviewer: that were on the base and I guess you-you're, you're particularly uh, security for uh, the jet fuel I guess it says. Interviewer: Uh, you know, I guess in the, some launchers, and flight line operations- yeah, so actually the whole kitten kaboodle, not just [inaudlble]- I read that first- um-  Interviewer: Was there any particularly stressful part of that job? Interviewer: And if so, how did you handle that stress? Veteran: Um,  Veteran: There wasn't really a particularly stressful part for me, uh, there was stressful situations. Veteran: Um, but they didn't reoccur. Uh, and, I-I dealth with those by uh-  Veteran: Assessing the situation, and seeing what needed to be done, and just executing it. Veteran: Uh, for example, I was driving around, checking on uh, sailage, and I saw a sailor trying to lift a uh, M4, up the security tower and a milk crate. Veteran: Uh- Interviewer: Ouch. Veteran: And so, like that was stressful because you know, if it falls out of the milk crate, it falls 40 feet, you can have a negligent discharge, or anything like that. Veteran: Um, so had some simple remedial training on why we don't do that, uh- Veteran: How that's a bad thing to be doing, and, uh, it stuck and that didn't happen again. Veteran: Um, another time we had a electrical fire at the fuel [inaudible]. Veteran: Uh, so you know, you just grab your fire extinguisher, put the fire out, um- Veteran: Fill out all the paperwork that goes along with it, and thankfully, we've got our engineers out there uh, got all-new panelling put in, uh, new electrical- Veteran: Uh, sources set up, and we didn't run into that issue again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | It was a little difficult to understand, but the examples he provided were related to the question. Uses his experience to provide a detailed response to the question.         |
| Over-explained  | Interviewer: Yeah, yeah yeah. Some interesting stories. Interesting. Interviewer: So um, u-u-uh you um, you listed that you uh, you were uh, you-you established and maintained and improved digital and voice communications networks across multiple bases for Enduring Freedom. Interviewer: Um, if you had to describe the improvement, you said you improved the communications, so- what  did you do to improve it and what was the measureable uh, effect of that? Veteran: Sure, uh, the main metric for us was range of communication and um- for voice networks, anyways, it was range. For digital networks it was speed, uh, so we deployed to Kandahar, there was one FOB and two small combat outposts there when we got there. Veteran: Uh, they were all radio to voice, um, satellite communications, and some HF stuff. Uh, so we came in for the- for the VHF stuff, we just added um, there was a mountain to our south at the very southern border of our AO. Veteran: So we put a retran station on the mountaintop, and that expanded the range that we could do, you know, patrol communications at. Uh, so the biggest concern for us was having, a fires net that uh you know, we could call for mortars, artillery, um, air support when we got it, which was mostly helicopters- talking to helicopters didn't really um, you know we didn't really have any restrictions there, helicopter's up in- pretty high up above the ground.  Veteran: And so, you can talk to them pretty easily.  Interviewer: All [inaudible] stuff, yeah.  Veteran: But uh, talking from the FOBs was really hard, especially when folks got into villages because you'd have these mud walls, and they're like, you know, 3 feet wide, and that- that uh, mud would just eat the uh, the radio uh, singal so you'd get- Veteran: So the main-main goal was setting up retran stations, and we did 2 of them, one on the mountaintop which I supported as a battallion-level commo guy and went down to a company-level and we'd set up another one at a small top so we had-we were expanding westward, and we set up a retran station there. Veteran: And then, that allowed us to push farther south and west, uh, so those would be the two main things, uh- Veteran: We're constantly repositioning antennaes, trying to improve the antennaes, um, I'm sure you know like, when you're doing expeditionary things, antennae you set up the first time is not the best. Uh, the best setup you can get, um, we had to, to um, re-run some cabling a few times, coax cables mostly, the stuff that had been weathered or holed- Veteran: Uh, when we got out to the base, but it was the stuff available, and we needed to um, you getget comm stations set up efficiently so, um Interviewer: Was it bad? Veteran: That and um, just regrounding systems, trying- once things were set up, just trying to work out any bugs that were in uh, uh, systems that you can communicate more effectively.  Veteran: With digital stuff, we'd set up, we'd use uh, these things that are called """"snap terminals"""" that are just pure satellite communications and then, but over the time we were able to get some uh, fiber optic lines ran, and then there was an HF antennae you could use to do, basically, cable internet- Veteran: -speeds. It wasn't quite that fast, but it was lightyears faster than the satellite communications. | Explains more than required, and the response has more repetitions.                                                                                                             |
