| **Under-explained** | Q: [...] can you tell me about a time when you built strong relationships, where none previously existed [...] <br> R: When I took over as a [...] sargeant [...] taking young young people into the army and showing them how to become a cohesive cohesive team                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Did not answer the question fully; vague. Gave little information and required prompting from the interviewer to elaborate. A more detailed example would be a better response. |
| **Succinct**        | Q: why should we select you for this job over another candidate? <br> R: I have my unique experiences that [...] nobody else does have. And I get, we, we're not going to know until I get there and I do it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Answered the question briefly and to the point.                                                                                                                                 |
| **Comprehensive**   | Q: Was there any particularly stressful part of that job? And if so, how did you handle that stress? <br> R: There wasn't really a particularly stressful part for me, uh, there was stressful situations. I dealt with those by [...] assessing the situation, and seeing what needed to be done, and just executing it. [...] for example, I was driving around [...] and I saw a [person] trying to lift a [...] that was stressful because [...] if it falls [...] you can have a negligent discharge [...].                                                                            | It was a little difficult to understand, but the examples he provided were related to the question. Uses his experience to provide a detailed response to the question.         |
| **Over-explained**  | Q: what  did you do to improve [...] and what was the measureable uh, effect of that? <br> R: the main metric for us was range of communication and [...] for voice networks [...] Uh, they were all radio to voice, um, satellite communications, and some HF stuff. [...] So we put a [...] station on the mountaintop, and that expanded the range [...]. Uh, so the biggest concern for us was having, a fires net that uh you know, we could call for [...] air support when we got it, which was mostly helicopters- [...] helicopter's up in- pretty high up above the ground. [...] | Explains more than required, and the response has more repetitions.                                                                                                             |
